    <releaseNotes>
      2.0.1.1

      2.0.0.1
      All obsolete code was removed. #C client won't support Appium server v lower than 1.5.0
      Source code migration to C# 6.0. Now this bundle requires .Net Framework > v4.5 or Mono Framework version which supports .Net Framework v4.5 with Lang Level 6.
      Update to Selenium.Webdriver v2.53.1 and Selenium.Support v2.53.1.
      Update to Newtonsoft.Json v9.0.1.
      Re-design of mobile searching strategies:
      - The class OpenQA.Selenium.Appium.MobileBy was added.
      - Classes ByAccessibilityId, ByAndroidUIAutomator, ByIosUIAutomation were grouped by the new class.
      - Static methods that create instances of ByAccessibilityId, ByAndroidUIAutomator, ByIosUIAutomation were added.
      The method public W GetNamedTextField(String name) was marked obsolete. It is going to be removed.
      ScrollTo() and ScrollToExact() became deprecated. They are going to be removed in the next release. The swiping action and OpenQA.Selenium.Appium.ByAndroidUIAutomator or
      OpenQA.Selenium.Appium.ByIosUIAutomation are recommended to use instead.
      Server flags were added:
      - GeneralOptionList.AsyncTrace
      - IOSOptionList.WebkitDebugProxyPort
      The SessionDetails property was added.  This property returns a dictionary of the current session data.
      FIX of the pinch/zoom issue. This change is supposed to be the temporary workaround. We are searching for a more convenient solution.
      It seems it requires some changes on the server side.
      FIX of the swiping issue (iOS, server version >= 1.5.0). Now the swiping is implemented differently by AndroidDriver and IOSDriver.
      the ability to start an activity using Android intent actions, intent categories, flags and arguments was added to OpenQA.Selenium.Appium.Android.AndroidDriver.
      The StartActivityWithIntent method.
      [Android] ability to push a common string as a file to the remote mobile device. The method was redesigned.
      [Android] ability to push base64 encoded bytes as a file to the remote mobile device. The method was added.
      [Android] ability to push a file as the file to the remote mobile device. The method was added.
      Constructors like AppiumDriver(ICommandExecutor commandExecutor, ICapabilities desiredCapabilities) were added to OpenQA.Selenium.Appium.Android.AndroidDriver and OpenQA.Selenium.Appium.iOS.IOSDriver. Also
      OpenQA.Selenium.Appium.AppiumCommand became public. The binding of these features may allow to use realated solutions of other vendors/modified Appium server builds which support JSONWP commands
      that default Appium/Selenium do not support.
      The SetImmediateValue method was moved to OpenQA.Selenium.Appium.AppiumWebElement. It works against text input elements on Android.

      1.5.1.1
      Update to Selenium.Webdriver v2.53.0 and Selenium.Support v2.53.0
      Update to Newtonsoft.Json v8.0.2
      FIXED The issue of compatibility of AppiumServiceBuilder with Appium node server v >= 1.5.x.
      Page object tools were updated. By.Name locator strategy is deprecated for Android and iOS. It is still valid for the Selendroid mode.
      The DeviceTime property was added and it works with Appium node 1.5
      improvements of locking methods. The LockDevice(seconds) is obsolete and it is going to be removed in the next release. Since Appium node server v1.5.x it is recommended to use AndroidDriver.Lock()()...AndroidDriver.Unlock() or IOSDriver.Lock(int seconds) instead.
      AndroidDriver.KeyEvent() is obsolete and it is going to be removed soon. Please use AndroidDriver.PressKeyCode or AndroidDriver.LongPressKeyCode instead.
      The GetAppStrings(string language = null) method is obsolete now. It is going to be removed.
      The  GetAppStringDictionary(string language = null, string stringFile = null) was added instead. It returns a dictionary with app strings (keys and values) instead of a string. Also it allows the searching app strings in the specified file.
      All capabilities were added according to https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/1.5/docs/en/writing-running-appium/caps.md. There are three classes:
      OpenQA.Selenium.Appium.Enums.MobileCapabilityType (just modified),
      OpenQA.Selenium.Appium.Enums.AndroidMobileCapabilityType (android-specific capabilities),
      OpenQA.Selenium.Appium.Enums.IOSMobileCapabilityType (iOS-specific capabilities).
      Some server flags were marked as obsolete because they are deprecated since server node v1.5.x. These options are going to be removed at the next .Net client release.
      The ability to start Appium node programmatically using desired capabilities. This feature is compatible with Appium node server v >= 1.5.x.
