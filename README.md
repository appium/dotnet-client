This driver is an extension of the [Selenium](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/) C# client. It has 
all the functionalities of the regular driver, but add Appium specific methods on top of this.

> **Note**

> The last stable version(v4.4.0) supports the legacy Selenium 3.150.0.<br/>	 
> In case you would like to use this client with Selenium 4.0 and above, please use the latest beta version(v5.0.0). <br/>
> We are well aware this project is not actively maintained, therefore any contributors are more than welcomed to assist with this project.

## NuGet

NuGet Package: [](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Appium.WebDriver/)

Dependencies:

- [Selenium.WebDriver](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Selenium.WebDriver/)
- [Newtonsoft.Json](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/)
- [Selenium.Support](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Selenium.Support/)
- [Castle.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Castle.Core/)

Note: we will NOT publish a signed version of this assembly since the dependencies we access through NuGet do not have a signed version - thus breaking the chain and causing us headaches. With that said, you are more than welcome to download the code and build a signed version yourself.
 
## Usage

### basics

- You need to add the following namespace line: `using OpenQA.Selenium.Appium;`.
- Use the `AppiumDriver` class/subclass to construct the driver. It works the same as the Selenium Webdriver, except that
 the ports are defaulted to Appium values, and the driver does not know how to start the Appium on its own.
- To use the Appium methods on Element, you need to specify the parameter of `AppiumDriver` or its subclasses.
